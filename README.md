# 📈 End-to-End Portfolio Optimization Research 🚀

## 📖 Abstract
In the current financial markets, where portfolio optimization remains a significant challenge, the dynamic changes in market conditions and investment demands render the development of an effective portfolio optimization framework more crucial than ever. This study introduces an end-to-end portfolio optimization framework, termed Quality-Growth-Momentum-Sentiment-Bayesian Optimization Asset Portfolio (QBOAP), aimed at constructing robust and profitable asset portfolios within the A-share stock market. The framework enhances both portfolio performance and trading value.

## 🔍 Key Research Focus
The research primarily focuses on three main issues:
1. **Feature Selection and Engineering**
2. **Optimization Problem / Loss Function Setting**
3. **Strategy Based on Optimal Weights**

## 🌟 QBOAP Framework Overview
- **QGMS Feature Set**: Utilizes the Quality-Growth-Momentum-Sentiment (QGMS) feature set to capture a comprehensive array of market information, ensuring that feature combinations are both representative and explanatory.
- **Novel Loss Function**: Employs a novel loss function within this framework, incorporating considerations of return curve stability and feature exposure, optimized using a Bayesian optimization algorithm to determine the optimal asset weights.
- **Weight Rank-Based Trading Strategy**: Integrates a weight rank-based trading strategy designed to minimize transaction costs and complexity, thereby improving overall trading value.

## 📊 Empirical Validation
Empirical validation through backtesting from 2017 to 2024 reveals that the QBOAP framework achieves the following performance metrics:
- **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)**: 0.216
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 1.46
- **Calmar Ratio**: 1.60

These metrics are superior to those of ten baseline models, demonstrating the framework’s effectiveness and offering valuable insights for the construction and optimization of A-share portfolios.
